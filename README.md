In this scripts I have used mysql and phpmyadmin for database and connecting to database and tkinter for GUI

Libraries used: tkinter - for GUI,  mysql-connector-python - for connecing to database 

I used WAMP server for locally hosting the phpmyadmin.

In this project there is two python files:
  1.mysql_connectivity.py  -  This file has all the database manpulation function not no GUI
  2.mysql_connectivity.py  -  This file has all the database manupulation but using GUI

Funtions:
    1.Display the entire table
    2.Display specific rows using ID, Name, or city
    3.Add rows into table
    4.Update the table
    5.Deletion of rows
